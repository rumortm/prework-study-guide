## Usage

To use this webpage effectivly, I have put notes into each of the sections. If you would like an idea of what to look into first, I would recommend going into the webpages console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You should find a list of topics I learned from the prework project along with suggestions on where to start.
